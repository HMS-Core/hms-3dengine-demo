## Introduction

This project contains simple examples of games developed on the HMS Core 3D Engine（Pinball3D）. This game uses the physical system of HMS Core 3D Engine to simulate the sphere collision in the real world. During the game, it is necessary to control the position of the pinball baffle as much as possible to avoid the pinball popping out of the game scene. Pinball3D is a small casual game controlled by the keyboard. You can also expand the basic functions of this game to create a richer and more playable game.

## Preparations

1）Environment installation: 3D Studio editor is a visual 3D application development tool provided by HMS Core 3D Engine for developers to improve the efficiency of 3D application development.[application](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/graphics-Guides/service-application-0000001240920342)

2）Configure the 3D Engine Settings.

## Environment Requirements

In order for the 3D Studio editor to function properly, the computer needs to meet certain hardware and software requirements.Details：[Installation environment](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/graphics-Guides/install-environment-0000001213664260)
