## Introduction

This project contains simple examples of games developed on the HMS Core 3D Engine(TableBall3D). This game uses the physics system of HMS Core 3D Engine to simulate the collision of spheres in the real world. In the game, you can control the back and forth movement of the cue ball and the rotation of the camera's Angle of view through keyboard input. Moreover, a points system is added in the game, which will increase the points when you hit the target ball.

## Preparations

1）Environment installation: 3D Studio editor is a visual 3D application development tool provided by HMS Core 3D Engine for developers to improve the efficiency of 3D application development.[application](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/graphics-Guides/service-application-0000001240920342)

2）Configure the 3D Engine Settings.

## Environment Requirements

In order for the 3D Studio editor to function properly, the computer needs to meet certain hardware and software requirements.Details：[Installation environment](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/graphics-Guides/install-environment-0000001213664260)
